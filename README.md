# Description

TAccuracy is aimed at users who are looking to improve their typing skills! Once you enter the game you have the two game modes to pick from; the 'Timed' mode, or the 'Words' mode. The timed mode allows you to decide how long each round will be, either 60s, 120s, or 180s. The words mode, gives you the option to pick how many words as a whole do you want to practice. After each round you would recieve your typing accuracy, and WPM (on the timed mode only). You always have the option to try again and beat your previous score!

### **How it works?**
***

From an array of the 4000 most used words of the English language, a randomly chosen number is assigned to the array which is then displayed to the screen. The process is repeated each time a word is completed. For the accuracy I compared each character of the displayed text to the relative character you typed, from that a percentage is calcuated.

Overall, as the first big project of mine, I am proud of it and happy to see how far I have come. The game is defintely not close to being effecient or up to par. It is basically made out of one very large 'If' statement. However, through the years I have learnt the mistakes from this project and focused on improving my Object Oriented Programming.
