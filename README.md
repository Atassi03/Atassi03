The first game I set out to make.

# Description

TAccuracy is aimed at users who are looking to improve their typing skills! Once you enter the game you have the two game modes to pick from; the 'Timed' mode, or the 'Words' mode. The timed mode allows you to decide how long each round will be, either 60s, 120s, or 180s. The words mode, gives you the option to pick how many words as a whole do you want to practice. After each round you would recieve your typing accuracy, and WPM (on the timed mode only). You always have the option to try again and beat your previous score!
